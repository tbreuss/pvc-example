# Example project for PVC

A simple example project based on [PVC](https://github.com/tbreuss/pvc), a minimal [M]VC framework.  
Just for my own experimentation and without any expectations.

## Installation

Composer is your friend.

    $ composer create-project tebe/pvc-example:@dev myproject

## Running

    $ cd myproject/public
    $ php -S localhost:9999

Start your web browser and open <http://localhost:9999>

You're ready to go!
