# Example project for PVC

A minimal [M]VC framework for learning and refreshing OOP in PHP. 
Just for my own experimentation and without any expectations.

## Installation

Composer is your friend.

    $ composer create-project tebe/pvc-example:@dev myproject

## Running

    $ cd myproject/public
    $ php -S localhost:9999

Start your web browser and open <http://localhost:9999>

### Basic Auth Middleware

The example is using some middlewares.

For the Basic Auth middleware the Login details are:

    Username: user
    Password: pass 

You're ready to go!
